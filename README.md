# Hi there, I'm CÃ©dric ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a high school student in Berlin, Germany, currently in the 10th grade. Here, you'll find projects and code that reflect my diverse interests and hobbies.

## About Me

- **Location:** Berlin, Germany (Lichterfelde)

## What I Do

I'm currently focusing on expanding my knowledge and skills in various areas, including:

- **Programming:** I'm always exploring new programming languages and tools. Right now, I'm particularly interested in Java, Python and Tailwind CSS.
- **Projects:** Check out my repositories to see some of my recent work. I'm working on a Python project called **Website-scanner**, a tool designed to scan a webpage for various types of media files, including images, videos, audios, and links to external video hosting sites. The tool downloads the found media files to a specified directory and logs the results for easy reference.

- **Flipper Zero:** I also own a Flipper Zero and enjoy writing scripts for it. If you don't know, the Flipper Zero is a versatile multi-tool for hackers and hardware enthusiasts.
- **NAS & Server:** I manage a NAS and a server, which has deepened my interest in network storage and server management.
